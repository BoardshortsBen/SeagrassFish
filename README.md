# Seagrass Structural Traits Drive Fish Assemblages in Small-Scale Fisheries
A repository for R code, scripts and data from the manuscript "Seagrass Structural Traits Drive Fish Assemblages in Small-Scale Fisheries" which investigates the best predictors of tropical seagrass fish assemblages, including seagrass cover, diversity, functional traits and structural complexity and places the findings in the context of small-scale fisheries in the Indo-Pacific Ocean.
